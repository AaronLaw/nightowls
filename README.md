# Introduction - version 0.4

Hello, I am Book.

You already know the twat who created me. He's the guy who can't keep his shit together long enough to start a business. That foreword you just read was all him. Idiot.

But I am Book! You will like me. 

It's going to take about <time> to read me through, but take it easy. That's just a suggestion calculated by some weird piece of software some guy probably wrote when he could barely see through the haze of caffeine.

I don't trust software. But I do trust developers, programmers, software engineers or however else you want to call them. Those guys seem to change their preferred noun every two weeks.

Have some tea. Or coffee. Glass of water?

I'm going to teach you about being _the best_. The best programmer, or the person programmers like best. I have no idea which you need more, so I'll just show you both.

## Keep in touch

Swizec is starting a newsletter about the things from Book. He's going to share interesting things about productivity, programmers, office culture and stuff like that about twice a month.

Sign up at: [http://swiz.ec/nightowls-list](http://swiz.ec/nightowls-list)

You can also poke swizec on Twitter as [@swizec](https://twitter.com/swizec) or send him an email at swizec@swizec.com. He loves hearing from people.

## Whom Book is for

You should read me if you are a programmer or have to deal with those weirdos all the time. If you have to wait until 11am for your favorite programmer to show up at work, or your favorite programmer won't even come to bed until 3am regardless of how sexy your lingerie. Read me!

If you're a mum or a dad and your young padawan of a programmer is acting strange - stays up all night and sleeps through school. I'll tell you why. And no, it's not drugs, it's pure awesome.

If one of your parents is a programmer and they keep making strange jokes. *"Yes mum, we know! The two hard things in computer science are cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. Ha ha."*. I'll help you understand that one too.

## What Book contains

I'm made up of roughly four sections.

First I'm going to talk about whether programmers do in fact work at night or do they just think they do so they can brag for hours on end about how little sleep they need.

Then we're going to go through some of the reasons they feel like night-time is the best time. I'll tell you what's going on and what's so hard about working during the day.

Lastly, I'm going to share some practical stuff aimed at people who aren't programmers, but have to deal with them and some other stuff for programmers so they can get along with normal people better, or just get more out of the night.

## What is not in Book

I am not hard science. You should take everything you read here with a grain of salt. While that Swizec guy did read a lot of academic papers on most things in here, he's also based a lot of it off anecdotal evidence and his and his friends' personal experiences.

He also sucks at keeping proper track of references. I try to smack him over the nose with a newspaper every time he cites something from a paper, but doesn't cite it properly. He rarely listens, but promises he'll try his best to get all of that in place.

## How finished is Book

Swizec is lazy - he prefers the euphemism "busy" - so it's taking him forever to finish me. It feels like I'm missing a whole body! I want one of those lovely figures you see on TV ...

If you are reading via [the Github repository](https://github.com/Swizec/nightowls), that's wonderful! Make sure to tell him what's wrong! Github Issues exist for a reason.

If you're reading via purchased pdf, that's _awesome_! You are a gentleman and a scholar and a great person to boot. Swizec asked me to say thanks for supporting the project.

Right now I'm version 0.4.

The interesting sections right now are **About flow** and **Working with programmers**. There's some interesting science about creativity and sleeping habits in **Why programmers work at night**.

The section of tips _for_ programmers was mostly written during long drives on a road trip around Europe. It's very interesting, but that lazy bastard still hasn't finished editing.

If you're into data, you should check out the preliminary analysis in **Do programmers work at night?**. Some 500,000 Github repositories were considered, but there's still much more data hiding in there.
