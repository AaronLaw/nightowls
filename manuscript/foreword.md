I was 21 when I quit my first real job.

What started out as a great opportunity for a high school senior to sharpen his coding chops at a small advertising agency, turned into daily frustration over management, stress and terrible working conditions.

The place was a creative's dream. Offices showered in natural light. Large windows overlooking a lush green park. Playful decor, walls covered in old design projects, sofas in the lounge, shelves full of books on design and marketing. A relaxed culture.

It was amazing. But also terrible.

Nobody had any real idea how programmers function. How we think, how we work, what we need to feel productive. For a long time I was the only programmer on the team.

On day one I was given an old laptop, a comfy chair and a spot on the large desk occupying most of an open-floor office. Across from me was a copywriter. On the right was the main designer. In the opposite corner sat another designer.

The boss had a separate desk behind a tall book shelf. He used to spend a lot of time on the phone or talking to his business partner. People often went to him with important questions. We could hear everything.

Eventually the team grew and a project manager joined our desk. She spent all her time on the phone or talking to the boss or both.

At first I was happy. The work was fun, it was new, and I even got paid to do what I loved.

But as the months and years passed the job became more and more stressful. I could no longer work on a cool internal project. There was too much client work.

Whenever I got a new project everything was already decided. I had barely managed to finish the previous project and the designers and business guys and clients had already specified a whole new thing by the time I could get to it. There was very little concern for what I could reasonably build.

With time I managed to inject myself into the project specification process more and I even established a workflow with the designers that helped them design things I could actually build. But this took a lot of effort and I was always too busy finishing the old project to participate in meetings.

At one point I was supporting so many old and new projects somebody would ask me to do something completely different every half hour.

My productivity was close to zero.

At the same time I was reading about how Google is a great place to work for, if you're an engineer. A company started by engineers for engineers. A nirvana where everyone understands you and knows exactly what you need.

I dreamt of founding the perfect company to work for. I didn't know what that meant, but I knew it was going to be cool and I will love working there.

After a few months I quit to focus on a side-project I had been developing over weekends and nights. In six months that project grew into a startup.

Two guys agreed to work with me for free. I couldn't really pay them, but we were going to build the next big thing in news consumption, have fun doing it and we'd all end up stinking rich as a result.

We didn't.

I spent every waking moment thinking about the startup. At all times I was either architecting a cool piece of tech, pouring my misguided ideas into code, creating business strategies, thinking about what the others were doing, or learning to be a better entrepreneur.

At one point it got so bad I was listening to entrepreneurship podcasts on my walk to the office, while I was eating and even when I went out for a run. All to squeeze that extra bit of productivity into the day.

My standard was 14 to 15 hours.

Everyone spent at least eleven hours a day at the basement office of a local hackerspace. We occupied a sofa, two tables, and three whiteboards. We were insane.

One by one we crashed and burned.

The other programmer was the first to go. He simply stopped coming to the office. He didn't answer any of my calls or emails. He went missing for a few weeks. His friends kept asking me if I'd seen him.

I don't really know what happened, but he was a really cool guy. I still feel bad for doing that to him. Last time we met he was working for an established startup in the area and finishing his studies. He didn't seem to hold a grudge.

He was the first to give up on us. But I was probably the first to start burning out. At one point I started taking long car rides to nothing. I would just sit in the car and drive aimlessly around the city listening to bad music on the radio.

I needed to be alone. At the office everyone expected something from me. Everyone expected me to be awesome, to inspire everyone to work hard, to woo investors, to keep my spirits up, to be perfect.

They didn't, but that's what it felt like. In my eyes I _was_ the startup. Without me there was nothing.

The car didn't judge.

Eventually I started coming into the office a husk. I would spend whole days aimlessly clicking around the internet. I would work by writing two lines of code then spending an hour looking at lolcats. My nights were spent doing everything I could think of that didn't involve the startup.

In March 2011 I got kicked out of the startup I had founded a year and five months prior. I deserved it. I was a terrible boss, I drove my guys like slaves, and I didn't listen to just about anyone.

On my way out the advisor slash investor said _"Dude, I know this hurts. But you need a lesson."_

I didn't think so at the time, but he was right. What I was doing, what I was expecting, was no way to lead a productive life as a programmer. It was no way to treat programmers and most importantly, it was even worse than the terrible working conditions I was trying to escape.

Ever since I have been actively searching for _the_ best way to be a  programmer. _The_ best way to treat programmers. _The_ best working environment to keep programmers happy, productive, and sane.

This book is about what I've learned.
