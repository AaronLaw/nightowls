# A primer on sleep science

Here will be some stuff about sleep science.

Especially how it relates to productivity and creativity, outline to be created when I've found&read more studies.

[a lot of this section has been sneaked into how-for-programmers, perhaps it fits better there, or those bits should be pulled from there to here]

### Shifting sleep schedules

Of course you _could_ code before 3pm, a lot of people do. You likely wouldn't lose a bet saying most employed programmers spend a lot of time at work before 3pm.

But without an external schedule coding at night just feels more natural. It's when the fun stuff happens.

You still need to sleep, though. What happens when you go to bed at two in the morning? You wake up at ten in the morning, perhaps nine. If you're really hardcore even at eight.

Come evening, you don't feel sleepy until midnight. You're just working on something interesting, so you keep working until 1am. Or slightly later.

Eventually your sleep cycle shifts into a different timezone because you keep going to bed later and later, because you've woken up much later and so on ad infinitum until your alarm clock and society pressure put you in an equilibrium of sorts.

For a lot of people that equilibrium seems to be waking up at 11am and going to bed at 3am. I don't know why.


### Bright screens

One of the biggest factors in human sleep-wake cycle is natural light. Scientists have shown that without external stimuli we would all be living on a roughly 26 hour cycle, but there are systems in our bodies that help us sync with the sun.

This is very important because days aren't equally long and before artificial lighting it wouldn't be very useful to stay awake for the same time in winter days as in summer days. Doesn't make sense and you need to conserve energy when it's cold anyway.

Modern lighting plays foul with those principles. Computer screens especially.

This is because the light coming off our screens is very white, aimed right at our eyes and usually insanely bright because monitors are set to stupid brightness levels by default and most people forget to change those.

All of this just plays back into the not-becoming-sleepy problem and keeps us up longer. Because we aren't sleepy, we might as well work huh?
