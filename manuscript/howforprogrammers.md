# Tips for programmers

You can't work all the time.

When I was 21 I founded my first startup after spending a few months on a pet project. I was CEO, CTO, lead programmer and full-time student. Two other blokes joined me for free. A great success because I had no money to pay them.

It was amazing. It was fulfilling. It was batshit insane.

I spent every waking moment thinking about the startup. Either I was architecting a clever piece of code, thinking about the business model, or talking people up about how awesome we were.

It got so bad at one point that I was listening to entrepreneurship podcasts on my commute, when I was eating, even when I went out for a run. Just so I could pack more productive hours into the day. My standard back then was 14 to 15. 

After a year and a half of this pace, I crashed. Bad.

On several nights I just sat in the car, picked a direction, and drove. Being alone in the night, with only the sound of a weak 1.6 liter engine, bad radio music, and light polluted skies for company.

It was perfect.

But not enough to undo the damage many months of being an idiot did. The product failed. The team dissipated.

These days I work less, achieve more, and rarely get tired.

## Energy levels

What about energy levels? I should do some research on this. Where do I get it? I instinctively know what to write about here, but I don't even have a clear definition of what are energy levels. Are we just talking about ego depletion, or is there something else? Is this something that goes in the sleep science section or not?

I know it's affected by food, exercise, sleep, and stimulants. But how is it affected? Does it always work the same? Is it just the function of sugar in your blood or is there more to it? Can you get tired even if you're well rested, is that then ego depletion?

What exactly should people do to maintain good levels? What even are good levels? What are we trying to achieve?

This is going to be a difficult chapter to write.

----

We want to achieve as stable as possible energy levels across the day because that means you get the most out of the day. Otherwise your'e going through highs and then falling so low you aren't getting much done. The thing to do is to eat regularly enough to never be hungry and to either drink caffeine constantly or not at all. It's important to avoid sugar as well.

But the problem is I still don't know what is an energy level. It needs to be something measurable. Just needs to. Othewrsie I can't really put it in the book â€¦ it needs a clear definition rather than just witchcraft and waving hands and stuff.

---

Intuitively, we all understand what our energy levels are. They're that thing that you have more of when you're rested and less of when you're feeling tired. Somebody who's full of energy is buzzing around and can barely contain themselves, while somebody who's low on energy usually just sits there staring straight ahead with an empty expression before their face - usually waiting for the coffeee to kick in.

Everybody also knows that their energy levels tend to fluctuate through the day depending on their natural cycle, how long they've been awake, what they've had to eat and so on.

For instance, a lot of people say they feel a spike of energy when it's not quite morning anymore, but it isn't lunch time yet either. Then they feel slow after lunch and have another peak in the afternoon before winding down for dinner and then some people have another spike later in the evening while others fall right asleep and never pick up until the next morning's work.

But what are we talking about when we say our energy levels fluctuate?

We're not talking about physical energy - that's measured in joules and relates direclty to physical work. It's a fascinating subject in the study of mechanics, but our feelings of energy don't have a lot to do with how much we can lift, or move, or how well we feel exercising.

Feeling low on energy doesn't mean that our physical energy is any lower, although it might be a little bit related. Just as having low physical energy doesn't have ot mean we also feel like we're out of energy. Our muslces can be tired and sore even when we're feeling full of energy and ready to take on the world.

What we actually mean when we say that we're feeling full of energy, is that our mental energy is high and we feel motivated and capable of doing mental work.

Scientists have been researching the concept of mental energy since the early 2000's using a combination of cognitive performance measurements, self-evaluation questionnnaires and physical tests.

They've discovered that our feelings of mental energy directly correlat to cognitive performance in terms of short term memory and and ability to take decisions quickly. It idd not sem to have much effect on other cognitive performance factors, otehr than just a general preference in terms of motivation - if your mental energy is high you'er goign to be more motivated to solving complex tasks and thus ygoign to perform better on them.

There's also a tendency to be able to hold focus better when you're rested, which correlates with a high mental energy, and thus is an indirec tfactor in your cognitive performance.

Interestingly enough, the same correlation seems to hold of phyriscal perfromance - if you're higher on mental energy, you will have more focus an da greater ability to overcome stressors, so you will be able to perform better physically. Mostly in terms of endurance and maximum strength.

 As such, there are two parts to the mental energy equation. On one hand it's a modd, which menas how much energy you _feel_ like you have. This affects your performance through motivatio.

On the other hand is a slightly more interesting actualmental energy, which measurably affects your cognitive performance in short term memory and decision tasks. It's more interesting because it's more measurable and its effect is more resonably pronounced.

More importantly, it's worth poitning out that you can have high mental energy, without actually feeign like you are high in enrgy.

[more stuff and specific quotes]

Therefore, your mental energy is a measure of how energetic you feel and how well you perform on mentaal tasks. It does not seem to affect anything else, neither does it affect most cognitive perfromance measures. Maintaining mental energy levels that are useful for quality programming therefore is mandatory.

The rest of this part of the book talks about lifestyle choices that affect mental energy and what kind of levels we actually aim for.

## Long hours

When I worked in a US startup for a month the  agreement was we focus on working normal hours. It was a new team so they listened to my advice that reasonable hours lead to more productivity than working all the time.

This might sound obvious if you're from Europe or if you're not used to working in startups. Most startups seems to adopt a US type of work culture anyway. Something about always being strapped for time and money and infinite competitors breathing down your neck and seemingly executing faster and better makes young people want to work insane hours to make up for whatever they feel they're missing.

but in this startup we were executing just fine working 11am to about 7pm. It was eight hours in total, but including lunch and the morning wound up before everyone starts being actually productive we were probably averaging about six hours of hard productivity per day.

A lot more than the four hours the usual office worker gets in an eight hour work day.

We were on a tight deadline of having a working minimum viable product ready to show investors within the month I was going to work with the team. When I say ready to show investors, I mean ready to let investors play with the product on their own. That means it's got to be production ready.

Going from zero lines of code to a production ready product in a month is a tall order so naturally you want to start as soon as you wake up and work until you fall asleep on your keyboard.

This is the wrong impulse.

There are no long distance sprinters. A month is a _a lot_ of time. At five days a week and six hours of hard productivity per day, a month gives you 120 hours, which is a lot more than it sounds.

A good engineer can do _a lot_ with 120 hours of focused productivity. Five of them can create a whole MVP!

After a month we did end up with a very presentable MVP that only needed a few minor touch ups, but towards the end we panicked. That last week was the perfect example of why programmers should never work long hours.

Friday was the day of the big investor meeting. What was supposed to be just a friendly ?Hey what are you up to? over lunch, turned into a proper meeting at the investor's office.

On MOnday we panicked.

The product was well on it sway, ub tyou know how software projects are. Until it's done, it look slike it's never goign to be done and those last few polishing touches take the longest.

There was no way we were going to let the founder go into that meeting with a product he doesn't feel comfortable letting the VC play with on their own. We decided to do what ever it takes.

That MOnday we took a very short lunch and worked until nine o'clock. To reward ourselves for getting a whole lot done, the engineering team went out for dinner together, tentatively planning to work more afterwards.

We just neeeded to get away from our ocmputers for a bit you see, we weren't tired at all. Oh no, who gets tired after a long-ish day of coding? Pfft, not us!

Dinner lasted until eleven o'clock and we didn't do any more work that day.

Next day people came in to work before 11am. By eleven, everyone had finished eating breakfast and was coding furiously. There was a deadline to catch and neither hell nor high water would make us miss it.

Lunch was a quick twenty minute break and we continued working furiously until six or seven in the evening the dynamic in the room started changing. There was more and more office chatter. First a conversation between two people wandering off into play land here and there, then more and more people migrating to the kitchen to stand around and chat.

By eight o'clock nobody was working.

They thought they were still working. After all, they were still at the office, they were talking about work, just nothing was getting done.

After a take-out dinner everyone got back to work around 10pm. At midnight, after some thirteen hours at the office, my brain reached a point where naming a new variable was a struggle, I stopped working.

Everyone else continued until 2am. I don't know how much they got done in those two extra hours, but the vibe was anything but the vibe of a bustling place where everyone is working at peak performance. It felt more like a town in the middle of a siesta.

Wednesday at 11am, the office was empty. Half the people staying at the house were barely waking up, the rest of us were eating breakfast. There was no sign yet of the commuters.

Lunch was ordered in once more to save on time. Everyone even managed to get their order in within five minutes this time. We were on fire!

But everyone also jumped off their computers much quicker than usual when delivery rang the bell. We sat outside in the shade; ate and talked. Everybody was taking their sweet time with the food. There was no rush, despite the looming deadline somehow nobody felt like getting up and going back to work.

Everybody was done eating in ten minutes. Lunch took an hour.

We just sat there and we talked. Some of it was about the work, some about the team, all of it completely unproductive. There was a lot of patting on the back over how productive we've been this week and how long hours we've worked. People need that. They say it as much to reassure themselves as to give kudos to the others.

That afternoon didn't feel as rushed and full of energy as Monday or Tuesday did. People were getting up to get something from the fridge much more often. When somebody went to the kitchen to prepare a small snack a lot more eyes followed than usual, a lot more people paid attention and decided that hell, they need a snack at this particular time as well.

I went for a run before dinner because it's a much better break than just eating an preparing dinner. Gets you out of the house for half an hour, gives you some time to think through coding problems and best of all, gives you alone time away from everybody else. They're good guys and all, but I need some alone time every day to recharge.

Better still, nobody questions a run. It's socially unacceptable to just take an hour long break when everyone else is still working. But nobody questions the habit of going for an evening run.

By the time I was back, nobody was working anymore. They were all hanging out in the kitchen making dinner. We decided to eat in to save time.

Dinner took until 10pm - two to three hours. Despite our efforts to save time.

Last person to type something into the text editor gave up at 3am. Everyone else had started shifting from work mode to play mode around midnight. Think I gave up at a quarter to one as soon as I reached some milestone I had set myself - spending the last two hours on a tiny little thing that could easily have been done in twenty minutes with a fresh mind the next morning.

But such is life with deadlines. Doing something in two hours that you could do tomorrow in 20 minutes.

On Thursday we started even later. I doubt anyone at the office typed anything into a text editor before 12:30. The vibe in the office was that of a train station without shade when it's 38C out.

Sluggish mechanical movements. No brain. Can only use muscle memory.

Better had we all stayed home instead of come to the office to pretend like we're being useful. But there was a deadline to catch don't you know! The product was coming together, but there were still bugs to iron out.

There will always be bugs to iron out.

That afternoon the founder announced the meeting had been postponed due to some scheduling conflict or another. A weight fell from the room and within an instant there was no more typing. No more deadly silence. Everyone stood up. Stretched. And started chatting.

At 7pm we stopped working. If anyone was even working at more than 20% ...

On friday we were back to normal. No deadline. No pressure to work super late. We got it done. That evening the product worked.

The new meeting was on Monday morning. Sunday afternoon was bug fixing day - first time in the company's history that people were expected to work on a weekend.

Dangerous precedent for a month old company to set, but they'll learn. Long hours are debt you repay on the third day.

### Types of schedules

But there are ways to work long hours without burning out in less than a week. Through experiments I've stumbled on a routine that's helped me work consistently long hours at full blast with barely a problem.

After my burn out two years ago I had to figure out a way to get a lot done without getting too tired. The schedule of jumping out of bed at 9am still full of caffeine from the guarana pills I had taken before bed and then working until 4am through a haze of black tea and energy drinks with one or two long breaks just wasn't sustainable anymore.

My biggest discovery was routine.

All my life I had prided myself on being a free spirit who doesn't plan anything too far in advance. I never kept a ready schedule, woke up when I felt like it, ate when I was hungry, slept when I couldn't work anymore.

That isn't very productive. You spend most of your time figuring out what you're going to do next. In the morning you have to think about what you're going to do before lunch, which deadlines are most imminent and what do you want to accomplish. Or just what you feel inspired to work on.

Not a very good way to catch deadlines, and not a great way to get anything done.

Something something routine.
