# Tips for programmers

You can't work all the time.

When I was 21 I founded my first startup after spending a few months on a pet project. I was CEO, CTO, lead programmer and full-time student. Two other blokes joined me for free. A great success because I had no money to pay them.

It was amazing. It was fulfilling. It was batshit insane.

I spent every waking moment thinking about the startup. Either I was architecting a clever piece of code, thinking about the business model, or talking people up about how awesome we were.

It got so bad at one point that I was listening to entrepreneurship podcasts on my commute, when I was eating, even when I went out for a run. Just so I could pack more productive hours into the day. My standard back then was 14 to 15. 

After a year and a half of this pace, I crashed. Bad.

On several nights I just sat in the car, picked a direction, and drove. Being alone in the night, with only the sound of a weak 1.6 liter engine, bad radio music, and light polluted skies for company.

It was perfect.

But not enough to undo the damage many months of being an idiot did. The product failed. The team dissipated.

These days I work less, achieve more, and rarely get tired.

## Energy levels

What about energy levels? I should do some research on this. Where do I get it? I instinctively know what to write about here, but I don't even have a clear definition of what are energy levels. Are we just talking about ego depletion, or is there something else? Is this something that goes in the sleep science section or not?

I know it's affected by food, exercise, sleep, and stimulants. But how is it affected? Does it always work the same? Is it just the function of sugar in your blood or is there more to it? Can youg et tired even if you're well rested, is that then ego depletion?

What exactly should people do to maintain good levels? What even are good levels? What are we trying to achieve?

This is going to be a difficult chapter to write.
